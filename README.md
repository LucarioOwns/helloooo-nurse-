My Coding Journey

Hi!! My Name is Roy Frias, I have a Bachelors Degree in Science as a Physical Education & Health teachers for kids K-12. 
I currently Work for Chase Bank, Now I am teaching myself HTML,CSS, and JAVASCRIPT. I've been teaching my self for about 3 weeks now and is super fun, its pretty difficult and confusing at times but you just gotta stick it out. When i first started going to college i started as a computer programmer I took C++, visual basics and intro to IT courses. I dropped out out of school after a year and just started working. It .took me about 5 years to go back to school and get my bachelors, and now im back to coding and I am glad im back
